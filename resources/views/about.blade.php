    	Created by Rebecca Doris, Boston Fare Hikes is a capstone project towards the completion of an ALM in Digital Media Design at Harvard. Doris lives in Somerville, Massachusetts without a car.

      The seeds of this idea were planted in December 2015, when on an impulse Doris went for a winter walk in Mount Auburn Cemetery guided by <a href="http://www.clarewalkerleslie.com/">Clare Walker Leslie</a>.
    She was struck by Leslie's words on the solace of nature. She often returned to the Mount Auburn Cemetery throughout winter 2016 for peace, comfort, and gentle exercise.

      When spring approached, Doris wanted to explore other natural spaces independently. Since she doesn't own a car, that required some research. She found that the information about T-accessible hikes was scarce, scattered, or outdated. Boston Fare Hikes would rectify that. At the end of spring 2016, she submitted her capstone proposal. She spent the entire summer visiting all of the locations featured on this website, relying entirely on the MBTA!

      The hope is that Boston Fare Hikes will be a useful resource for car-free Bostonians looking for some active serenity.
